# Ecare - APP Designed For Elder People
With an ever-evolving transport system, people require the means to plan and carry out their journeys more safely and efficiently than before. This is especially true of elderly people, who have the disadvantage of being unfamiliar with current mobile devices, and of having special needs in some cases.

The application is mainly for assisted people to get to their destinations with ease of access, special features to simplify their journey and everyday life. It is also an extremely useful tool for the assisted people and their carers to communicate with each other.
